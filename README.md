# DevOps UE: Assignment 2<br>Docker and Dockerfile deploy to a local K8s cluster

## Objective

**Assignment objective:** Gain insights into Kubernetes and container orchestration.<br>
**Key concepts:** Pods, ReplicaSets, and Deployments in Kubernetes.<br>
**Requirements:** Utilize a local Kubernetes cluster (e.g., Kind, Rancher).

## Task

- Deploy a containerized web application on your local Kubernetes cluster.
- Implement a rolling update strategy for zero-downtime deployments.
- Scale the application by adjusting replica counts using Kubernetes commands.
- The application should be accessed by your local machine.

## Solution

### 1. Add a liveness / health endpoint in the web app

- Add a `health.ts` file to provide a liveness and readiness check for Kubernetes

  - Created file at `src/pages/api/health.ts` with the following content:

  ```
  export default function handler(req, res) {
    res.status(200).json({ status: "ok" });
  }
  ```

  - Update `next.config.js` to include the health endpoint rewrite:

  ```
  rewrites: async () => {
    return [
      {
        source: "/health",
        destination: "/api/health",
      },
    ];
  },
  ```

### 2. Push the web app to a image registry (DockerHub)

**Merge pull request from f/assignment2 to release pipeline using GitHub Actions:**

- Build the Docker image for the web app
- Push the Docker image to DockerHub, ensuring it is available for the Kubernetes cluster deployment

### 3. Scaling strategies

1. Rolling update strategy

- The deployment is configured with a rolling update strategy to gradually replace Pods, ensuring zero downtime during the process.

2. Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)

- Configure a `nextjs-hpa.yaml` file to monitor CPU utilization and automatically scale the number of replicas between 3 and 10.
- This ensures that the application can handle increased traffic without downtime while maintaining optimal resource utilization.

### 4. How to assert that the deployment works as expected?

1. Apply Kubernetes configuration files

```
kubectl apply -f k8s/nextjs-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/nextjs-service.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/nextjs-hpa.yaml
```

2. Access test

- Open `http://localhost:3000` in a browser to confirm that the web application is accessible on my local machine.

3. Health check

- Access the `/health` endpoint (`http://localhost:3000/health`) to ensure that the web application is running and healthy.

4. Benchmarking the application

- Use Apache Benchmark (`ab`) to test the application's performance:
  ```
  ab -n 10000 -c 100 http://localhost:3000/
  ```
- There were no failed requests and the application handled the load efficiently.

  ```
  Benchmarking localhost (be patient)

  Completed 2000 requests
  Completed 3000 requests
  Completed 4000 requests

  Finished 10000 requests

  ```

5. Scaling verification

- Monitor the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler using `kubectl get hpa` to verify that the number of replicas adjusted correctly based on CPU usage.

```
NAME                 REFERENCE                          TARGETS         MINPODS   MAXPODS   REPLICAS
startup-nextjs-hpa   Deployment/startup-nextjs-fabian   <unknown>/50%   3         10        0
```

### 5. YAML files

1. Deployment YAML (`k8s/nextjs-deployment.yaml`)

- The `nextjs-deployment.yaml` defines the deployment with a rolling update strategy, liveness and readiness probes.

```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: startup-nextjs-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: startup-nextjs-fabian
  strategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
    rollingUpdate:
      maxSurge: 1
      maxUnavailable: 0
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: startup-nextjs-fabian
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: startup-nextjs-fabian
          image: fabiannaether/startup-nextjs-fabian:latest
          ports:
            - containerPort: 3000
          readinessProbe:
            httpGet:
              path: /health
              port: 3000
            initialDelaySeconds: 5
            periodSeconds: 10
          livenessProbe:
            httpGet:
              path: /health
              port: 3000
            initialDelaySeconds: 15
            periodSeconds: 20
```

2. Service YAML (`k8s/nextjs-service.yaml`)

- The `nextjs-service.yaml` defines a LoadBalancer service to expose the application, enabling access from outside the Kubernetes cluster.

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: startup-nextjs-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: startup-nextjs-fabian
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 3000
      targetPort: 3000
  type: LoadBalancer
```

3. Horizontal Pod Autoscaler YAML (`k8s/nextjs-hpa.yaml`)

- The `nextjs-hpa.yaml` configures the HPA to scale based on CPU utilization.

```
apiVersion: autoscaling/v1
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: startup-nextjs-hpa
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: startup-nextjs-fabian
  minReplicas: 3
  maxReplicas: 10
  targetCPUUtilizationPercentage: 50
```

**Desired behaviour:**

The desired behaviour for this deployment is to have a responsive, scalable web application that maintains zero-downtime and adjusts according to traffic:

1. Zero downtime

- The `RollingUpdate` strategy with `maxSurge: 1` and `maxUnavailable: 0` ensures that at least one new Pod is created before an old Pod is terminated, preventing any service disruption.

2. Scalability

- The `HorizontalPodAutoscaler` (HPA) is set up to monitor CPU usage and scale replicas between 3 and 10, ensuring that the application can handle varying traffic loads efficiently.

3. Liveness and Readiness Probes

- The liveness and readiness probes monitor the application's health at `/health` to ensure that the Pods are ready to serve traffic.

4. Monitoring the HPA

- By running `kubectl get hpa`, I can verify that the HPA is scaling the application correctly based on the CPU utilization metrics.
